# ReScript MSW

This package is intended to be an ergonomic, data-first, wrapper for ReScript bindings to [msw](https://mswjs.io/), particularly for usage with [graphql_ppx](https://graphql-ppx.com/). It can also be used for REST APIs, especially in combination with JSON codecs like:

- [rescript-json-combinators](https://github.com/glennsl/rescript-json-combinators)
- [bs-json](https://github.com/glennsl/bs-json)
- [rescript-struct](https://github.com/DZakh/rescript-struct)

## Usage
